Problem Challenge 3
Count of Structurally Unique Binary Search Trees (hard)
Given a number ‘n’, write a function to return the count of structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BST) that can store values 1 to ‘n’.
Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: As we saw in the previous problem, there are 2 unique BSTs storing numbers from 1-2.
Example 2:
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation: There will be 5 unique BSTs that can store numbers from 1 to 5.
