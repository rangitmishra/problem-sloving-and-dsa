Problem Challenge 2
Structurally Unique Binary Search Trees (hard)
Given a number ‘n’, write a function to return all structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BST) that can store values 1 to ‘n’?
Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: List containing root nodes of all structurally unique BSTs.
Explanation: Here are the 2 structurally unique BSTs storing all numbers from 1 to 2:
Example 2:
Input: 3
Output: List containing root nodes of all structurally unique BSTs.
Explanation: Here are the 5 structurally unique BSTs storing all numbers from 1 to 3:
