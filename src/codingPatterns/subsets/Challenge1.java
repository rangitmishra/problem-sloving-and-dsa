Problem Challenge 1
Evaluate Expression (hard)
Given an expression containing digits and operations (+, -, *),
find all possible ways in which the expression can be evaluated by grouping the numbers and operators using parentheses.
Example 1:
Input: "1+2*3"
Output: 7, 9
Explanation: 1+(2*3) => 7 and (1+2)*3 => 9
Example 2:
Input: "2*3-4-5"
Output: 8, -12, 7, -7, -3
Explanation: 2*(3-(4-5)) => 8, 2*(3-4-5) => -12, 2*3-(4-5) => 7, 2*(3-4)-5 => -7, (2*3)-4-5 => -3
