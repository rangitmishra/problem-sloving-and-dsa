We are given an array of n Passengers; each element, passengers[i], represents the weight of a passenger.
We are given an infinite number of boats, and each boat may carry a maximum weight of max_weight.
Each boat can only carry two passengers at a time as long as the total weight of those passengers does not exceed the maximum weight.

We have to find the least number of boats required to transport each individual.

n = 4
passengers = [ 4, 1, 3, 5 ]
max_weight = 5

Where n is the size of passengers array that represents the weights, and the maximum weight each boat can carry is given
by max_weight, and max_weight >= passengers[i]

output = 3
