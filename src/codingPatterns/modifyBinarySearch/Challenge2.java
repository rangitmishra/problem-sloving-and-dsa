Problem Challenge 2
Search in Rotated Array (medium)
Given an array of numbers which is sorted in ascending order and also rotated by some arbitrary number,
find if a given ‘key’ is present in it.
Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’ in the rotated array. If the ‘key’ is not present, return -1.
You can assume that the given array does not have any duplicates.
Example 1:
Input: [10, 15, 1, 3, 8], key = 15
Output: 1
Explanation: '15' is present in the array at index '1'.
Example 2:
Input: [4, 5, 7, 9, 10, -1, 2], key = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: '10' is present in the array at index '4'.
