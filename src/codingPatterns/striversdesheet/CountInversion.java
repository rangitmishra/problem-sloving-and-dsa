/*
What is an inversion of an array? Definition: for all i & j < size of array,
if i < j then you have to find pair (A[i],A[j]) such that A[j] < A[i].

Example 3:
Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {5,3,2,1,4}
Result: 7
Explanation: There are 7 pairs (5,1), (5,3), (5,2), (5,4),(3,2), (3,1), (2,1)
and we have left 2 pairs (2,4) and (1,4) as both are not satisfy our condition.
