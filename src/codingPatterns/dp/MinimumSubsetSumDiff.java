Problem Statement
Given a set of positive numbers, partition the set into two subsets with minimum difference between their subset sums.
Example 1:
Input: {1, 2, 3, 9}
Output: 3
Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where minimum absolute difference
between the sum of numbers is '3'. Following are the two subsets: {1, 2, 3} & {9}.
Example 2:
Input: {1, 2, 7, 1, 5}
Output: 0
Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where minimum absolute difference
between the sum of number is '0'. Following are the two subsets: {1, 2, 5} & {7, 1}.
Example 3:
Input: {1, 3, 100, 4}
Output: 92
Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where minimum absolute difference
between the sum of numbers is '92'. Here are the two subsets: {1, 3, 4} & {100}.
